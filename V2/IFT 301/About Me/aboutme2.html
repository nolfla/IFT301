            <p>A personal goal of mine for this year is to get more fit in terms of having lean muscle and doing the
                exercises correctly. My professional goal is to be able to obtain a summer technology internship to add

        <h1>Interesting Information</h1>
        <p>One of my really good family friends was born in Germany at a military base. My dad can speak some German
            since he took it in college. I have a close friend who was a previous IT major (has a lot of server
            experience) and switched over to being a flight major. My mom's side of the family is Italian, Irish, and
            British. My dad's side is German, possibly Dutch and others.</p>
