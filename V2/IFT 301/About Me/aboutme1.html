        <p>I am from San Diego, CA and can <b> speak German fluently</b>, while spending a total of 7 weeks in Germany

        <h1>Interesting Information</h1>
        <p>One of my really good family friends was born in Germany at a military base. My dad can speak some German since he took it in college. I have a close friend who was a previous IT major (has a lot of server experience) and switched over to being a flight major. My mom's side of the family is Italian, Irish, and British. My dad's side is German, possibly Dutch and others.</p>
